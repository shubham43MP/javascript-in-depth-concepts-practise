# Javascript

## Javascript basics:

- Promise, ES6, ASYNC AWAIT, CALLBACKS, closures, currying
- Explain Event loop in JS
- Promise.all() ?
- setTimeout vs setInterval
- What are web workers?
- What do you understand about primitive data types in Javascript? Which are primitive and non-primitive data types? Are primitive data types immutable?
- What are called Stack and Heaps?
- Call Stack stores values of primitives.
- Heap is where values of non-primitives are stored - good for dynamic data arrays and objects.
- Change is memory address - let allows you to change the memory address, const does not! var works similarly but it doesn't respect scoping
- When myArray is declared, a memory address is allocated on the call stack, and the value is a memory address that is allocated on the heap
- Reference
- What is an IIFE in JavaScript? IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.
- What is the difference between arrow function and normal function?
- What are falsy values in JS? 6 null false, 0 undefined?
