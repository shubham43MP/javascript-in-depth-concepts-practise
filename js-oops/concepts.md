# JS OOPS

## Abstraction

## Encapsuation

## Inheritance

## Polymorphism


## Factory Function
- A function that returns a configurable object to create is a factory function. `Refer oops-p1.js`
- Those who prefer functional sorts of programming away from classical OOPS can prefer Factory functions.
- Javascript is not a classical OOPS based language

## Constructor Function
- A function that  utilising the new keyword  as well as the this keyword for purposes of instance or so is a Concturctor function
- More close to C#, Java, C++ approach.
- Without the use of new keyword here, the this would point to global object
